The testing was done using the Google Chrome Browser. Chrome Developer Tools was used extensively, particularly to check responsiveness on different screen sizes. Testing was also done using Firefox on desktop, and again on Google Chrome.
* Responsive on all device sizes.

## Manual Testing

All the points features mentioned below were tested manually.

- All buttons function correctly, redirect user as intended.
- Timer works properly and Best time is updated when expected.
- Highest win streaks for different levels are upgraded when expected.
- All game modes function as expected.

## Unfixed Bugs

- The timer does not pause when the game is ended prematurely or when the user finishes the game before the time is up. Debugging and fixing this issue will be a priority for future updates.

## Fixed Bugs

- I dedicated significant effort to resolving a critical bug wherein, upon game initiation, cards could be clicked multiple times, resulting in erroneous score updates. To rectify this issue, I removed the event listener for card clicks outside of the main function and reinstated it only when the cards were flipped back.

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
